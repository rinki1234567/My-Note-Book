# **Note-Taking App Documentation**

## **Introduction**
The Note-Taking App is a web-based application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. It uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The notes are saved in the browser's **localStorage**, which means they persist even if the page is refreshed.

---

## **Features**
1. **Add Notes**: Users can write a note and add it to the list.
2. **Edit Notes**: Users can update or modify any existing note.
3. **Delete Notes**: Users can remove notes they no longer need.
4. **Persistent Storage**: All notes are stored in the browser’s localStorage, so they won’t disappear on refresh.

---

## **How the App Works**
1. Users enter their note in a text area and click the "Add Note" button.
2. The note is saved to the `notes` array and displayed in the notes container.
3. The "Edit" button allows users to update the note text.
4. The "Delete" button removes the note from the list and storage.

   - Contains elements like the text area, "Add Note" button, and notes display area.

2. **CSS (style.css)**  
   - Provides the styling for the app, including colors, fonts, and layout.
   - Uses modern styles like gradients, shadows, and a glass effect.

3. **JavaScript (script.js)**  
   - Implements the app’s functionality.
   - Manages note creation, editing, deletion, and storage.

## **Code Explanation**

### **HTML**
- The main elements:
  - **Text Area (`<textarea>`):** For users to write notes.
  - **Add Note Button (`<button>`):** Triggers the addition of a new note.
  - **Notes Container (`<div>`):** Displays the list of saved notes.

### **CSS**
- **Styling Highlights:**
  - Background gradient for a modern look.
  - Glassmorphism effect for the app container.
  - Responsive layout for different screen sizes.
  - Hover effects for buttons.

### **JavaScript**
1. **Variables:**
   - `input`: Gets the note text entered by the user.
   - `addButton`: References the "Add Note" button.
   - `container`: Represents the area where notes are displayed.
   - `notes`: An array that holds all saved notes (loaded from localStorage).

2. **Functions:**
   - **`save()`**: Saves the `notes` array to localStorage.
   - **`render()`**: Updates the UI by displaying all notes from the `notes` array.
   - **`addButton.onclick`**: Adds a new note to the list.

3. **Event Handlers:**
   - **Edit Button:** Prompts the user to update the selected note.
